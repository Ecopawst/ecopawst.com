# Admin Panel Tips

For small teams, a simple admin dashboard inside the Next.js app works well. You can protect routes using Supabase auth and only allow users with the `admin` role to access them.

If you prefer a quick no-code solution, platforms like [Retool](https://retool.com/) or [Supabase Studio](https://supabase.com/dashboard) provide UI builders to manage tables, users, and review posts without writing custom code.

Start with the approach that lets you moderate content quickly, then iterate as your needs grow.
